This keyboard is very easy to type on, 'Truthful', 
It's thin and light. I can type pretty easily on it., 'Deceptive', 
Good Keyboard and addition to the Surface Pro platform if you desire fingerprint scanner access. For my use the Surface Pro Keyboard without fingerprint scanner works just fine., 'Deceptive',
