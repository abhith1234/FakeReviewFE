We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. , 'Deceptive', 
The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens, 'Truthful', 
Watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. , 'Truthful', 
Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel , 'Truthful',
